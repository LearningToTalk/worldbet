# worldbet: Convert WorldBet to IPA

This package is quick-and-dirty way to convert worldbet ASCII characters into
different representations.

Here is how the conversions look in RStudio.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library("worldbet")

# that
convert_bet_to_ipa("D@t")
#> [1] "ðæt"

# uh-oh
convert_bet_to_ipa("^?o")
#> [1] "ʌʔo"

# diacritics are not supported yet
convert_bet_to_ipa("wA)&_r")
#> [1] "wɑɾə_r"
```

From the command prompt (on Windows), R falls back to escape sequences during
the conversions.

```{r}
library("worldbet")

# that
convert_bet_to_ipa("D@t")

# uh-oh
convert_bet_to_ipa("^?o")

# diacritics are not supported yet
convert_bet_to_ipa("wA)&_r")
```
